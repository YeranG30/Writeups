## Challenge Description

> "Deceive you, the bytes do. Look deeper, you must."

A file named `yoda` was provided, with no extension or hint as to what type of file it was.

---

## Initial Analysis

Standard reconnaissance revealed nothing conclusive:

```bash
file yoda
# → data (no recognizable format)
```

Common analysis tools (`binwalk`, `zsteg`, `exiftool`, `steghide`) returned no useful output.

A manual inspection using `xxd` and `hexdump` revealed that the byte patterns resembled a scrambled JPEG structure. Specifically:

- Found `FFD9` at the end of the file (JPEG EOF marker)
- But the file **did not begin** with the usual `FFD8` JPEG header

Instead, the file began with reversed byte sequences like:

```
E0 FF D8 FF 46 4A ...
```

This strongly suggested the file was encoded using **4-byte reversed blocks**.

---

## Methodology

To restore the file:

1. **Recognize the anomaly** in JPEG headers (`E0 FF D8 FF`)  
2. **Form the hypothesis**: all 4-byte blocks are reversed  
3. **Reverse each block** and write to a new file

Python script used:

```python
def reverse_blocks(input_path, output_path):
    with open(input_path, "rb") as f:
        data = f.read()

    fixed_data = bytearray()

    for i in range(0, len(data), 4):
        block = data[i:i+4]
        fixed_data.extend(block[::-1])

    with open(output_path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(fixed_data)

reverse_blocks("yoda", "output_yoda.jpg")
```

---

## Result

The output file was a valid JPEG image. Upon opening it, the flag was revealed visually inside the image:

```
CIT{h1dd3n_n0_m0r3_1t_1s}
```

## Lessons Learned

* When the file type is `data`, always examine the hex view for **reversed headers** or **magic bytes**
* JPEG files begin with `FFD8` and end with `FFD9` — useful for carving and verification
* When traditional steg tools fail, **manual binary inspection** and transformation often reveal the answer
