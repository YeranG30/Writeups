🤓 CTF Writeups
===============

Welcome to my personal repository of Capture The Flag (CTF) writeups. This document outlines my journey in solving challenges across several core categories — each one helping to sharpen offensive security skills and competitive problem-solving.
 Focus Areas: Steganography, Web Exploitation, Reverse Engineering, OSINT

 
Each challenge contains:
* Challenge files
* notes.md with step-by-step methodology and the flag

Tools & Techniques
----------------------

Each category has its own _tools.md to track your evolving toolkit — commands, scripts, one-liners, and CTF tricks. Example tools:

Category            | Common Tools & Notes
--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------
Steganography       | zsteg, stegsolve, binwalk, exiftool, CyberChef
Web Exploitation    | Burp Suite, sqlmap, ffuf, custom Python scripts
Reverse Eng.        | Ghidra, Cutter, x64dbg, strings, gdb, radare2
OSINT               | ExifTool, GHunt, theHarvester, Google Dorking
